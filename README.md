### 💡 Philosophy

I specialize in **seeing problems before markets recognize them**:

- **2000** - Built digital ticketing systems before Eventbrite existed
- **2004** - Pioneered multi-venue festivals when venues wouldn't cooperate  
- **2020** - Integrated NFTs into gaming before "Web3" was mainstream
- **2024** - First to build MCP servers for blockchain interaction

*"Sometimes being too early is the same as being wrong—but when the market catches up, the impact is transformative."*
